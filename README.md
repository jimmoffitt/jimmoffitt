### 👋 Hi there and welcome 👋

So, here is a collection of repositories written mainly in Python and Ruby, with a fair amount of JavaScript mixed in. If GitHub had been around when I developed flood-warning systems in Java and Visual Basic, there'd be some examples in those languages ;)   

- 💬 Ask me about designing and building APIs and helping partners and developers use those APIs. Areas of focus: real-time data streaming, event-driven architectures, early-warning systems, and working with social and weather data.

## Some background  

I recently left a Spanish start-up named [Tinybird]((https://www.tinybird.co/) (a fabulous product and team, now HQ'ed in NYC), and am now looking for my next career chapter.  The last four chapters have been amazing. 

I joined Tinybird in April 2023 as a developer advocate so you will see a set of Tinybird-related projects here (others on the Tinybird account). [Here](https://github.com/jimmoffitt/jimmoffitt/blob/master/tinybird.md) is a summary of the blog posts, workshops, and other projects I focused on while there. Some of my favorites include building an anomaly detection system, designing a Weather API, and developing a workshop to show data engineers how to build APIs on top of real-time Kafka streams. 
  
For eight years I was on the Twitter developer relations team, and as such, many of these repositories are focused on collecting, analyzing, and displaying Twitter data. See [HERE](https://github.com/jimmoffitt/jimmoffitt/blob/master/twitter.md) for a directory of repositories and example projects. See [HERE]() for more details on projects from my years at Twitter. 
  
For more than a decade before joining Gnip, I developed flood-warning software, so you may notice that a certain use case drives most of these efforts...
