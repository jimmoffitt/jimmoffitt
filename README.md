### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So, here is a collection of repositories written mainly in Python and Ruby, with a fair amount of JavaScript mixed in. 

For eight years I was on the Twitter developer relations team, and as such, most of these repositories are focused on collecting, analyzing, and displaying Twitter data. These repositories can be broken up into three types:

- 'Backend' scripts that make API requests, receive the data, and typically store that data somewhere (or if a simple example, just send it off to the ether). 
  - https://github.com/twitterdev/search-tweets-python/tree/v2
  - https://github.com/twitterdev/search-tweets-ruby

- Web applications in the form of standalone websites or chatbot applications hosted on Twitter. 
  - https://github.com/twitterdev/SnowBotDev 
  - https://github.com/jimmoffitt/SocialFlood

- Customer tools for working with Twitter data. 
  - https://github.com/jimmoffitt/json2csv
  - https://github.com/jimmoffitt/bounding-boxes
  - https://github.com/jimmoffitt/rules-migrator

During the 13 years before Gnip/Twitter, I developed flood-warning software, so you may notice a certain use case dominates. 

And finally, I am searching for the next chapter in my career... I'm excited to see where I land ;) 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting a Windows 11 laptop set up for development. I've been working with the MacOS for a decade now, and I know it will be interesting to return to Windows. With terminal emulators, virtual machines, and a current IDE, I am hoping I'll be on the OS agnostic road soon.
