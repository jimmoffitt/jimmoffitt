# Tinybird

Here is a collection of content I developed while at Tinybird: 

## Blog posts 

* [Designing and implementing a weather data API](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/designing-and-implementing-a-weather-data-api) - Revisitied my flood-warning system experience in the Tinybird context.
* [8 considerations for designing public data APIs](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/8-considerations-for-designing-public-data-apis) - A high-level view of building public APIs and how Tinybird helps abstract away many backend concerns when storing and publishing real-time data. 
* [Real-time anomaly detection](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/real-time-anomaly-detection) - My favorite Tinybird project.
* Ghost wrote this with a Tinybird Python guru: [Killing the ProcessPoolExecutor](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/killing-the-processpoolexecutor) - One of my favorite writing projects. I learned a lot and it's always fun collaborating with engineers.

During the summer of 2023, we experimented with writing high-level content for [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/):
* [The basics of event-driven architectures](https://thenewstack.io/the-basics-of-event-driven-architectures/)
* [Change data capture for real-time access to backend databases](https://thenewstack.io/change-data-capture-for-real-time-access-to-backend-databases/)
* [The fundamentals of data API design](https://thenewstack.io/the-fundamentals-of-data-api-design/)
* [Real-time databases: Who is using them and why](https://thenewstack.io/real-time-databases-who-is-using-them-and-why/)

During my Tinybird travels, I also had a great introduction to change data capture, and a deep dive into real-time leaderboards. 
* [A practical guide to real-time CDC with Postgres](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/postgres-cdc)
* [A practical guide to real-time CDC with MySQL](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/mysql-cdc)
* [Building real-time leaderboards with Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/building-real-time-leaderboards-with-tinybird)
