# The joy of technical writing (really!) 

Writing is probably my preferred way of communicating about technical things. I am a visual learner, and words and pictures help me more quickly understand technical topics. During my career, I have spent a lot of time writing, including my decade at Gnip/Twitter, where there was always a new product/endpoint to document, and a growing variety of developers to write for. My Twitter documentation roots go back to Gnip and being a primary author of documention for a set of 'enterprise' products. That includes the real-time streaming and historical search endpoints that became the foundation of Twitter API 2.0 versions. 

Below are some Twitter highlights, but there are also many examples from earlier in my career:

* For my Master of Science in Civil Engineering, I wrote a thesis on the monitoring and modeling of snowmelt at the former nuclear trigger manufacturing site, Rocky Flats, south of Boulder. The 253-page beast had 9 chapters, and 7 appendices. 
* At a small engineering company, as a developer and product manager, I led the content and production for this new version manual for a flood-warning software used across the US: https://manualzz.com/doc/o/p9bxh/diadvisor-user-s-manaul-diadvisor-workgroup (I did not misspell 'manual'!)
