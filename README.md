### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there and welcome ðŸ‘‹

So, here is a collection of repositories written mainly in Python and Ruby, with a fair amount of JavaScript mixed in. 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about designing and building APIs and helping partners and developers use those APIs. Areas of focus: real-time data streaming, event-driven architectures, early-warning systems, and working with social and weather data.

## Some background  

I recently left a Spanish start-up named Tinybird (a fabulous product and team), and am now looking for my next career chapter.  The last four chapters have been amazing. 

I joined [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) in April 2023 as a developer advocate so you will see a set of Tinybird-related projects here (others on the Tinybird account). [Here](https://github.com/jimmoffitt/jimmoffitt/blob/master/tinybird.md) is a summary of the blog posts, workshops, and other projects I focused on while there. Some of my favorites include building an anomaly detection system, designing a Weather API, and developing a workshop to show data engineers how to build APIs on top of real-time Kafka streams. 
  
For eight years I was on the Twitter developer relations team, and as such, many of these repositories are focused on collecting, analyzing, and displaying Twitter data. See [HERE](https://github.com/jimmoffitt/jimmoffitt/blob/master/twitter.md) for a directory of repositories and example projects. The repositories can be broken up into three types:

- 'Backend' scripts that make Twitter Search API requests, receive the data, and typically store that data somewhere (or if a simple example, just send it off into the ether). 
- Web applications in the form of standalone websites or chatbot applications hosted on Twitter. Chatbot projects included a "Snow Bot" that shares snow conditions and portals for users to enroll in weather notification systems. In 2016-2017, I went deep into Twitter data use cases related to flood-warning systems. This and other related content led to receiving two national awards for innovation related to public safety and weather communications. 
- Customer tools for working with Twitter data. Built a set of tools to help work with Twitter data and products. Example projects include a tool for refactoring JSON as CSV, generating geographic metadata needed to search geo-referenced Tweets and tools to help customers migrate to new Twitter API versions.  
  
During the 13 years before Gnip/Twitter, I developed flood-warning software, so you may notice that a certain use case drives most of these efforts...
